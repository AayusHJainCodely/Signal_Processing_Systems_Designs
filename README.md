### âœ… Q1: PCM Simulation with Quantization and Interpolation

- **Objective:** Simulate Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) using different quantization levels and analyze the impact of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) on SNR.
- **Signal Processing Techniques:**
  - Uniform and Non-Uniform Quantization (Î¼-law)
  - AWGN modeling
  - SNR computation
  - Interpolation: linear, spline, cubic
- **Plots:**
  - Original vs. Quantized vs. Noisy signals
  - Quantization error visualization
  - SNR trends with varying quantization levels

> **Key Insight:** SNR improves with higher quantization levels. Noise effects are more prominent at lower levels. Î¼-law companding helps preserve low-amplitude signals better.

### âœ… Q2: Delta Modulation vs. Adaptive Delta Modulation

- **Objective:** Compare standard DM and ADM using sinusoidal and speech signals.
- **Signal Processing Techniques:**
  - Bit-wise encoding
  - Adaptive step size control based on signal derivative
  - BER and MSE calculations
- **Plots:**
  - Original signal vs. DM and ADM reconstructions
  - Step-size variation in ADM
- **Results:**
  - ADM shows better reconstruction for speech signals.
  - BER and MSE comparisons highlight ADMâ€™s adaptability.

> **Key Insight:** Adaptive modulation improves tracking performance on signals with varying slopes, especially speech.

### âœ… Q3: Î¼-law and A-law Companding

- **Objective:** Implement and compare Î¼-law and A-law companding against uniform quantization.
- **Signal Processing Techniques:**
  - Logarithmic companding (encoding/decoding)
  - SNR comparison
- **Plots:**
  - Original vs. Compressed and Expanded signal
- **Results:**
  - **Î¼-law SNR:** 136.93 dB (best)
  - **A-law SNR:** -4.58 dB (poor implementation noted)
  - **Uniform SNR:** 43.44 dB

> **Key Insight:** Î¼-law greatly improves SNR by compressing dynamic range before quantization. A-law requires review for correctness.

### âœ… Q4: Differential PCM (DPCM) for Image Compression

- **Objective:** Compare DPCM and standard PCM in image compression.
- **Signal Processing Techniques:**
  - Linear prediction
  - Differential quantization
  - MSE and bandwidth efficiency computation
- **Plots:**
  - Original vs. PCM-decoded vs. DPCM-decoded image
- **Results:**
  - DPCM has significantly lower quantization error.
  - Compression ratios are identical (bit-depth controlled).
  - DPCM offers better visual quality with the same bit-rate.

> **Key Insight:** DPCM leverages signal redundancy, offering better performance at fixed bit depth compared to PCM.

### âœ… Q5: Speech-to-Text using DM and MFCC + SVM

- **Objective:** Recognize spoken digits using a machine learning model trained on MFCC features from DM-encoded audio.
- **Signal Processing Techniques:**
  - Delta modulation preprocessing
  - MFCC feature extraction
  - SVM classification
- **Results:**
  - **Dataset:** Free Spoken Digit Dataset (~3,000 files)
  - **Classifier Accuracy:** 96.00%
  - **Confusion Matrix:** High accuracy across all digits

> **Key Insight:** Even with low-bitrate encoding like delta modulation, robust classification is possible with MFCC + SVM.
